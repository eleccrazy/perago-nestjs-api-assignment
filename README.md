## Description

A simple CRUD API for organization position structure. This API is built for managing organization position structure with different level of positions/roles hierarchy. At the top of the hierarchy there is root position e.g. CEO, and every position below a given hierarchy will answer/report to the position above it except the root position. The API is built with NestJS framework, PostgreSQL, and TypeOrm with the CQRS pattern.

#### Implemented Status Codes

- `200 - OK (GET), (PATCH), (DELETE) => Incase of successful request`
- `201 - Created (POST) => Incase of successful creation of a new position`
- `400 - Bad Request (POST), Bad Request (PATCH) => Incase of invalid request body`
- `404 - Not Found (GET), (PATCH), (DELETE) => Incase of invalid id`
- `500 - Internal Server Error (GET), (POST), (PATCH), (DELETE) => Incase of any unhandled error`

#### Rules for creating a new position /api/positions

- The `name` field is required and must be a string
- The `description` field is required and must be a string
- The `name` field must be unique, i.e, no two positions can have the same name
- The `name` field must be atleast 2 characters long
- The `description` field must be atleast 6 characters long
- The `parentId` field is required and must be a valid position id (uuid)
- The `parentId` is not required if the position is the root position (i.e, the first position to be created)
- If you set the `parentId` field while creating the first position, you will get a bad request error telling you that the `Parent Position Not Found`, which is logical because there is no position in the database yet.

#### Rules for updating a position /api/positions/:id

- The `id` parameter is required and must be a valid position id (uuid)
- The `name`, `description`, and `parentId` can be updated, and they must follow the same rules as creating a new position
- The `name` field must be unique, i.e, no two positions can have the same name
- While upating the `parentId`, the new `parentId` must not be the same as the `id` of the position being updated. The position cannot be its own parent.
- While upating the `parentId`, the new `parentId` must not be the same as the `id` of any of its child positions

#### Rules for deleting a position /api/positions/:id

- The `id` parameter is required and must be a valid position id (uuid)
- A position can only be deleted if it has no child positions

#### Rules for getting a position /api/positions/:id

- The `id` parameter is required and must be a valid position id (uuid)
- The response will not include its child positions

#### Rules for getting childrens of a position /api/positions/:id/childrens

- The `id` parameter is required and must be a valid position id (uuid)
- The response will include all of its child positions

#### Rules for getting all positions /api/positions

- No rules just make a GET request to the endpoint
- The response will include all positions in the database

#### Rules for getting the tree structure of all positions /api/positions/tree

- No rules just make a GET request to the endpoint
- The response will include all positions in the database in a tree structure

## Example Request to get the tree structure of all positions

### Request
